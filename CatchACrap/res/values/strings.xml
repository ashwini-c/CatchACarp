    <string name="info">Koi carp (
Cyprinus carpio
) were selectively bred from wild
stock in Asia and Europe and were introduced to New
Zealand as ornamental pond fish in the 1960s. In the
lower Waikato and Auckland region, koi carp inhabit lakes,
wetlands, streams, drains and rivers. Small populations
have been found in other locations around the North
Island, but so far they have not established in the South
Island.\n\n
In New Zealand, they can grow to 70 cm long and weigh
up to 14 kg. Males live to about 8 years and females to
around 12 years. Koi carp spawn in shallow river and lake
margins. A female koi carp is capable of multiple spawnings
per year producing on average 100,000 eggs per kilogram
of body weight.\n\n
Juvenile koi carp are zooplanktivores, thus inhabit water
with poor trophic status. The adults are omnivores that eat
invertebrates, plants, fish eggs and small fish. They suck
up sediment with their extensible mouths, extract what
they eat and expel the remains. This leads to increased
suspended sediment in the water column reducing
water clarity, submerged aquatic plants, and habitat for
zooplankton and small fish.\n</string>
